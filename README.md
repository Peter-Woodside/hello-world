## Hello World learning how to create a repository.

I am a student earning my bachelor of science in IT. I am just learning how to code in HTML and now I am learning how to use GitHub. I am nervous about his endeavor, but am enjoying the journey. The following is a list of the things I have learned so far.
1. Learning the basics of coding using the *Coral* language.
2. Learning the *HTML* language.
3. Learning *CSS*.

Now I am trying to learn the *Markdown* syntax.
| **Syntax** | **Description** |
| ---------- | --------------- |
| Header     |  Title          |
|'Paragraph' | 'Text'          |
| X<sup>8</sup>       |  C<sub>6<sub/>|
